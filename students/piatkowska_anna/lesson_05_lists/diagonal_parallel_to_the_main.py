'''
Given an integer n, produce a two-dimensional array of size (n√ón)
and complete it according to the following rules,
and print with a single space between characters:
On the main diagonal write 0 .
On the diagonals adjacent to the main, write 1.
On the next adjacent diagonals write 2 and so forth.
Print the elements of the resulting array.
